# Kaboom Flappy Bird_Game
This repository contains the sprites and scripts to build a variation of Flappy Bird using Kaboom.Js v3000

The game is built using Google Apps Script and deployed as a WebApp. In order to do so, 4 files are created:

- Code.gs
- index.html
- css.html
- js.html
  
The Kaboom code is all written within the js.html file. Sprites for the game are located in the Game_Sprites folder.  All code is derived and modified based on the [Medium article](https://medium.com/@mithileshpatel/flying-jack-my-first-game-in-kaboom-js-f84dfbda4290) written by Mithilesh Kr. Patel
